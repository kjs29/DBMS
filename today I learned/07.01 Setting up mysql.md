# Setting up mysql

(Source - [SQL tutorial youtube video](https://youtu.be/HXV3zeQKqGY))

1. Download mysql from [mysql website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

2. Use command to add path to system's PATH variable so that 'mysql' command can run from any directory in the terminal.

```
echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zprofile
```

3. Log in mysql server

```
mysql -u root -p
```

4. Change password to 'password'

```
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

5. Exit

```
exit
```

6. Try logggin in again with a new password

```
mysql -u root -p
```

7. Create database

```
create database practice;
```

```
create database practice;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```

Now we successfully connected to the localhost mysql server.

We can perform anything with terminal. But we will use popsql, that helps with visualizations of mysql.
