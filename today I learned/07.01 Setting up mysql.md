1. Download mysql from [mysql website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

2. Use command to add path to system's PATH variable so that 'mysql' command can run from any directory in the terminal.

```
echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zprofile
```

3. Log in mysql server

```
mysql -u root -p
```

4. Change password to 'password'

```
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

5. Exit

```
exit
```

6. Try logggin in again with a new password

```
mysql -u root -p
```

7. Create database

```
create database practice;
```

```
create database practice;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
```

Now we successfully connected to the localhost mysql server.

We can perform anything with terminal. But we will use popsql, that helps with visualizations of mysql.

# Datatypes

```sql
INT                     -- Whole numbers
DECIMAL(M,N)            -- Decimal numbers (M : total digit, N: decimal places)
VARCHAR(1)              -- String of text of length 1
BLOB                    -- Binary Large Object, Stores large data
DATE                    -- 'YYYY-MM-DD'
TIMESTAMP               -- 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' - used for recording 
```

# Create table

|student_id|name|major|gpa|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Jack|Biology|4.0|
|2|Kate|Sociology|3.52|
|3|Claire|English|2.89|
|4|Jack|Biology|3.87|
|5|Mike|Computer Science|

(`student_id` is the primary key)

To create table like the chart shown, we can write

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(40),
    gpa DECIMAL(3,2),
    PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
);
```

`CREATE TABLE student ();` :

`student` is the name of the table.

`student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT` : the name of this attribute is called student_id, and it contains whole numbers. When this was not added manually, it is incremented by 1 automatically.

`name VARCHAR(20)` : this attribute is called name, and it contains characters, and its max length is 20.

`major VARCHAR(40)` : this attribute is called major, and it contains characters, and its max length is 40.

`gpa DECIMAL(3,2)` : this attribute is called gpa, and it has total 3 digits, and 2 of them are for decimal places.

`PRIMARY KEY(student_id)` : this determines `student_id` is a primary key.

# To see the structure of the table

```sql
DESCRIBE student;
```

https://popsql.com/queries/-NZHcltEADwKuFiVbHOY/untitled-query-jul-1-2023?run_id=42249256

# To delete the table

```sql
DROP TABLE student;
```


# To add column

```sql
ALTER TABLE student ADD age INT;
```

# To delete column

```sql
ALTER TABLE student DROP gpa;
```

# To insert data

```sql
INSERT into student VALUES(1, 'Jack', 'Biology')
```

We have to follow the order of how we structured the columns initially.

In this case, student_id, name, and major (We deleted gpa column)

### To insert only student_id, and attribute name

```sql
INSERT into student(student_id, name) VALUES(2, 'Kate');
```

# To see all the columns in the student table

```sql
SELECT * FROM student;
```

# set constraints


If we want to make all the students who didn't pick their major specified 'undecided',

We can write `DEFAULT 'undecided'.

Regularly, I would create a table like this.

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(40),
);
```

We can add `DEFAULT undecided` after `VARCHAR(40)`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE student(
    student_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(40) DEFAULT('undecided'),
);
```

Let's try to see if Jack's major is undecided now after not inserting Jack's major yet.

```sql
INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(1, 'Jack');
```

|student_id|name|major|
|---|---|---|
|1|Jack|undecided|


## How to make student_id auto incremented

We can put `AUTO_INCREMENT`

```sql
CREATE TABLE student(
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(40) DEFAULT('undecided'),
);
```

## How to insert multiple data at the same time,

Let's create a new table

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(40) DEFAULT('undecided'),
    PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO student(name, major)        -- insert two columns name and major
VALUES
    ('Jack', DEFAULT),                  -- jack's major will be undecided
    ('Kate', 'Biology'),
    ('Jinsung', 'Computer Science'),
    ('Holland', 'Computer Science'),
    ('JK', 'Electrical Engineering');
```

# Update 

1. If we want to change the major name from 'Computer Science' to 'CS',

```sql
UPDATE student
SET major = 'CS'
WHERE major = 'Computer Science';
```

Result:

https://popsql.com/queries/-NZHcltEADwKuFiVbHOY/untitled-query-jul-1-2023?run_id=42249825

2. If we want to change all the students whose majors are either 'CS' or 'Electrical Engineering' to 'Technology', 

```sql
UPDATE student
SET major = 'Technology'
WHERE major = 'CS' OR major = 'Electrical Engineering';
```

Result:

https://popsql.com/queries/-NZHcltEADwKuFiVbHOY/untitled-query-jul-1-2023?run_id=42250497

3. If we want to add a new student and add him in the database so that his student_id is 1 and major 'Politics'.

First we need to change all the existing primary keys to negative numbers.

```sql
UPDATE student
SET student_id = student_id * -1
WHERE student_id >= 1;
```

Now all the students student_ids are negatives, -1, -2, -3, and so on.

Secondly, we need to add  to the database.

```sql
INSERT INTO student(student_id, name, major) VALUES(1, 'Paul', 'Politics');
```

Lastly, we can change all the rest student_id back to positive numbers and subtract each by 1.

```sql
UPDATE student
SET student_id = student_id * -1 + 1
WHERE student_id < 0;
```

# How to retrieve specific data

- Get all the rows and columns from student table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM student;
```

- Get only name column, and major column from student table.

```sql
SELECT name, major
FROM student;
```

- Get only name column, and major column which have student_id > 3 from student table.

```sql
SELECT name, major
FROM student
WHERE student_id > 3;
```

- Get ONLY name and major column, with descending order of student_id from student table.

```sql
SELECT name, major
FROM student
ORDER BY student_id DESC;
```

By default, it is in ascending order.

- Get all columns, with ascending order of major, and then student_id from student table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
ORDER BY major, student_id;
```

The result will show 

- Get all the columns with only 3 results from student table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
LIMIT 3;
```

- Get no duplicate answer

Question: In the given table employees, retrieve the distinct values of the department column using SQL. Write a query that includes the DISTINCT keyword to ensure that the result set only contains unique department values.

Table: employees

| employee_id | employee_name | department |
|1|	John Smith|	Sales |
|2|	Jane Doe|	Marketing|
|3|	David Johnson|	Sales|
|4|	Emily Brown|	HR|
|5|	Michael Lee	|Marketing|

Write a SQL query to obtain the distinct values of the department column from the employees table, ensuring that duplicate department values are excluded from the result set.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT employees.department
FROM employees;
```

We can write DISTINCT keyword to get rid of the duplicate results.
