# Create table

# Datatypes

```sql
INT                     -- Whole numbers
DECIMAL(M,N)            -- Decimal numbers (M : total digit, N: decimal places)
VARCHAR(1)              -- String of text of length 1
BLOB                    -- Binary Large Object, Stores large data
DATE                    -- 'YYYY-MM-DD'
TIMESTAMP               -- 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' - used for recording 
```

# Glossary

SQL : Structured Query Language. It is used for interacting with RDBMS(Relational Database Management Systems)

Table : A collection of related data entries. It consists of rows and columns.

Queries : A set of instructions given to RDBMS to retrieve information users want to look for.

Example of queries

```sql
SELECT student.student_id
FROM student
WHERE student_id BETWEEN 50 AND 99;
```

Primary Key : A unique identifier that differentiates from other columns.

Examples of primary keys: email addresses, student_id, emp_id, etc.

    - Composite Key : The primary key that needs two attributes. Each individual attribute does not identify the table, but combination of both does.

Foreign Key: It stores the primary key of another table. It is a way to define relationship between the two. One table can have multiple foreign keys.



Foreign Key


# Create table

|student_id|name|major|gpa|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Jack|Biology|4.0|
|2|Kate|Sociology|3.52|
|3|Claire|English|2.89|
|4|Jack|Biology|3.87|
|5|Mike|Computer Science|

(`student_id` is the primary key)

To create table like the chart shown, we can write

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(40),
    gpa DECIMAL(3,2),
    PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
);
```

or

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(30),
    major VARCHAR(40)
);
```

We will walk through the first code snippet.

`CREATE TABLE student ();` : `student` is the name of the table.

`student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT` : the name of this attribute is called student_id, and it contains whole numbers. When this was not added manually, it is incremented by 1 automatically.

`name VARCHAR(20)` : this attribute is called name, and it contains characters, and its max length is 20.

`major VARCHAR(40)` : this attribute is called major, and it contains characters, and its max length is 40.

`gpa DECIMAL(3,2)` : this attribute is called gpa, and it has total 3 digits, and 2 of them are for decimal places. For instance, 3.92  .

`PRIMARY KEY(student_id)` : this determines `student_id` is a primary key.

# Different commands

## To print the structure of a table
```sql
-- to view the structure of a table
DESCRIBE student;
```

[A structure of a table](https://popsql.com/queries/-NZHcltEADwKuFiVbHOY/untitled-query-jul-1-2023?run_id=42249256)


## To delete

```sql
-- to delete a table
DROP TABLE student;

-- to delete a column 'gpa'
ALTER TABLE student DROP gpa;
```

## To add column

```sql
ALTER TABLE student ADD age INT;
```

## To insert data

```sql
-- to insert a row with corresponding values
INSERT into student VALUES(1, 'Jack', 'Biology')
```

We have to follow the order of how we structured the columns initially.

In this case, student_id, name, and major (We deleted gpa column)

```sql
-- insert a row with only student_id, and the name
INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(3,'Claire');
```

## To view the whole values in the 'student' table

```sql
-- to see all the columns and rows in the student table
SELECT * FROM student;
```

# How to insert multiple data at once

Let's create a new table

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(40) DEFAULT('undecided'),
    PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO student(name, major)        -- insert two columns name and major
VALUES
    ('Jack', DEFAULT),                  -- jack's major will be undecided
    ('Kate', 'Biology'),
    ('Jinsung', 'Computer Science'),
    ('Holland', 'Computer Science'),
    ('JK', 'Electrical Engineering');
```

# Set constraints

If we want to make all the students who didn't pick their major specified 'undecided',

We can write `DEFAULT 'undecided'.

Regularly, I would create a table like this.

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(40),
);
```

We can add `DEFAULT undecided` after `VARCHAR(40)`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE student(
    student_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(40) DEFAULT('undecided'),
);
```

Let's try to see if Jack's major is undecided now after not inserting Jack's major yet.

```sql
INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(1, 'Jack');
```

|student_id|name|major|
|---|---|---|
|1|Jack|undecided|

## How to set a column where `NULL` value can't go
```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    major VARCHAR(40),
    PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
);
```

Now if we try to add any column that has value of `NULL` in `name` column, it will show an error.

```sql
-- This will show error because name can't be NULL value
INSERT INTO student VALUES(1,'Jack','Biology');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(2,'Kate','Sociology');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(3, NULL, 'Chemistry');
```

## How to set a column where only unique value can go

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(40) UNIQUE,
    PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
);
```

```sql
-- This will show error because major should be unique
INSERT INTO student VALUES(1,'Jack','Biology');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(2,'Kate','Sociology');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(3, 'Jack', 'Biology');
```

## How to make student_id auto incremented

We can put `AUTO_INCREMENT` in `student_id`

```sql
CREATE TABLE student(
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(40) DEFAULT('undecided'),
    PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
);
```

Without `AUTO_INCREMENT`, we need to add rows like this.

```sql
INSERT INTO student VALUES(1,'Jack','Biology');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(2,'Kate','Sociology');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(3, 'Jack', 'Biology');
```

Without `AUTO_INCREMENT`, we don't have to write `student_id` when we add values.

```sql
INSERT INTO student(name, major) VALUES('Jack','Biology');
INSERT INTO student(name, major) VALUES('Kate','Sociology');
```

# UPDATE

Basic syntax

```
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

Example.

```sql
-- in the table 'students', change grade to 'A' for those who got higher than 90
UPDATE students
SET grade = 'A'
WHERE score > 90;
```

## 1. Set a basic constraint

We have a table like this below.

student

|student_id*|name|major|
|---|---|---|
|1|Jack|undecided|
|2|Kate|biology|
|3|Jinsung|Computer Science|
|4|Holland|Computer Science|
|5|JK|Electrical Engineering|

If we want to change the major name from 'Computer Science' to 'CS',

```sql
UPDATE student
SET major = 'CS'
WHERE major = 'Computer Science';
```

Result:

https://popsql.com/queries/-NZHcltEADwKuFiVbHOY/untitled-query-jul-1-2023?run_id=42249825

## 2. Multiple constraints

We have a table like this below.

student

|student_id*|name|major|
|---|---|---|
|1|Jack|undecided|
|2|Kate|biology|
|3|Jinsung|Computer Science|
|4|Holland|Computer Science|
|5|JK|Electrical Engineering|

If we want to change all the students whose majors are either 'CS' or 'Electrical Engineering' to 'Technology', 

```sql
UPDATE student
SET major = 'Technology'
WHERE major = 'CS' OR major = 'Electrical Engineering';
```

Result:

https://popsql.com/queries/-NZHcltEADwKuFiVbHOY/untitled-query-jul-1-2023?run_id=42250497

## 3. Set multiple values

Let's say we want to change the major to 'undecided', and the name to 'Tom' for a student whose student_id is 1.

We have a table like this below.

student

|student_id*|name|major|
|---|---|---|
|1|Jack|Biology|
|2|Kate|biology|
|3|Jinsung|Technology|
|4|Holland|Technology|
|5|JK|Technology|

```sql
UPDATE student
SET major = 'undecided', name = 'Tom'
WHERE student_id = 1;
```

Result:

|student_id*|name|major|
|---|---|---|
|1|Tom|undecided|
|2|Kate|biology|
|3|Jinsung|Technology|
|4|Holland|Technology|
|5|JK|Technology|

## 4. Insert the first row at the beginning

We have a table like this below.

student

|student_id*|name|major|
|---|---|---|
|1|Jack|undecided|
|2|Kate|biology|
|3|Jinsung|Technology|
|4|Holland|Technology|
|5|JK|Technology|

If we want to add a new student and add him in the database so that his student_id is 1 and major 'Politics'.

First we need to change all the existing primary keys to negative numbers.

```sql
UPDATE student
SET student_id = student_id * -1
WHERE student_id >= 1;
```

Now all the students student_ids are negatives, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1.

https://popsql.com/queries/-NZHcltEADwKuFiVbHOY/untitled-query-jul-1-2023?run_id=42257161

Secondly, we need to add  to the database.

```sql
INSERT INTO student(student_id, name, major) VALUES(1, 'Paul', 'Politics');
```

https://popsql.com/queries/-NZHcltEADwKuFiVbHOY/untitled-query-jul-1-2023?run_id=42257167

Lastly, we can change all the rest student_id back to positive numbers and subtract each by 1.

```sql
UPDATE student
SET student_id = student_id * -1 + 1
WHERE student_id < 0;
```

https://popsql.com/queries/-NZHcltEADwKuFiVbHOY/untitled-query-jul-1-2023?run_id=42257210


# Questions about UPDATE

## Q1

Imagine you have a table named `employees` with the following columns:

`employee_id`: an integer representing the unique ID of the employee.

`first_name`: a string representing the first name of the employee.

`last_name`: a string representing the last name of the employee.

`salary`: a decimal representing the salary of the employee.

`department`: a string representing the department the employee belongs to.

You have been tasked to update the salary of all employees in the IT department by adding 5000 to their current salary.

Write an SQL UPDATE statement to perform this operation.

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary + 5000
WHERE department = 'IT';
```

## Q2: Syntax Understanding

Given a table named `orders` with columns `order_id`, `product_name`, and `quantity`. 

Write an SQL UPDATE query to increase the quantity by 5 for the order with `order_id` 102.

```sql
UPDATE orders
SET quantity = quantity + 5
WHERE order_id = 102
```

## Q3: Conditional Update:

How would you write an UPDATE statement to modify the `salary` in the `employees` table, 

giving a 10% raise only to employees in the 'Finance' department with a salary under 50000?

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.1
WHERE department = 'Finance' AND salary < 50000;
```

## Q4: Using Subqueries in Update

Assume you have two tables, `customers` with `customer_id` and `customer_name`, and `orders` with `order_id`, `customer_id`, and `order_total`. 

How would you write an UPDATE statement to set the `customer_name` to 'Preferred Customer' for all customers who have an `order_total` greater than 1000 in the `orders` table?

```sql
UPDATE customers
SET customer_name = 'Preferred Customer'
WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE order_total > 1000);
```

## Q5: Updating Multiple Columns:

Write an SQL UPDATE query to change both the `email` and `phone_number` columns in the contacts table to 'no.reply@company.com', '000-000-0000' for the entry with `contact_id` 205.

```sql
UPDATE contacts
SET email = 'no.reply@company.com', phone_number = '000-000-0000'
WHERE contact_id = 205;
```

## Q6: Limiting Updates

In MySQL, how can you use the UPDATE statement to change the status column to 'Processed' for only the first 10 rows in the `tasks` table where status is 'Pending'?

```sql
UPDATE tasks
SET status = 'Processed'
WHERE status = 'Pending'
LIMIT 10;
```

# DELETE

Basic syntax

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

Example.

```sql
-- Delete department 'CD Sales' from a table 'sales'
DELETE FROM sales
WHERE department = 'CD Sales';
```

`DELETE` commands permanently delete, so first retrieve the information with `SELECT` before performing `DELETE`.

## Question 1:
Write a SQL query to delete all records from the `Orders` table where the `OrderDate` is older than January 1, 2022.

```sql
DELETE FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate < '2022-01-01';
```

## Question 2:
You have a `Products` table with columns `ProductID`, `ProductName`, `StockQuantity`, and `Category`. Write a SQL query to delete all products in the `Books` category.

```sql
DELETE FROM Products
Where Category = 'Books';
```

## Question 3:
The `Employees` table has a `DepartmentID` and a `Status` column. Write a SQL query to delete all records of employees in Department 5 who have a status of 'Resigned'.

```sql
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID = 5 AND Status = 'Resigned';
```

## Question 4:
You have a `Customers` table with a `Country` column. Write a SQL query to delete all customers who are not located in the 'USA'.

```sql
DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE Country != 'USA';
```

## Question 5:
In the `Movies` table, write a SQL query to delete all movies that have a `Rating` less than 5 and were `Released` before the year 2000.

```sql
DELETE FROM Movies
WHERE Rating < 5 AND Released < 2000;
```

# <!important>How to retrieve specific data (SELECT)

Basic syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM tableName
WHERE condition;
```

`column1`, `column2`, ...: The names of the columns in the table from which you want to retrieve data. You can also use `*` to select all columns.

`tableName`: The name of the table from which you want to retrieve data.

WHERE condition: Optional. The condition that must be satisfied for a row to be included in the result set.

Examples.

```sql
-- Get all the rows and columns from student table.
SELECT * FROM student;
```

```sql
-- Select FirstName and LastName columns from 'Employees' table
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees;
```

```sql
-- Select FirstName, and LastName columns from 'Employees' table, where their department is 'IT'
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'IT';
```

```sql
-- Get only name column, and major column which have student_id > 3 from student table.
SELECT name, major
FROM student
WHERE student_id > 3;
```

```sql
-- Get ONLY name and major column, with descending order of student_id from student table.
SELECT name, major
FROM student
ORDER BY student_id DESC;
```

By default, it is in ascending order.

```sql
-- Get all columns, with ascending order of major, and then student_id from student table.
SELECT *
FROM student
ORDER BY major, student_id;
```

Limiting SELECT

```sql
-- Get all the columns with only 3 results from student table.
SELECT *
FROM student
LIMIT 3;
```

# Questions

## Q1: Retrieve All Employees from the Sales Department

Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for employees who work in the 'Sales' department from the `employees` table. The table has columns `employee_id`, `employee_name`, and `department`.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

## Q2: Fetch the Top 5 Highest Salary Employees:
Given a `salary` table with columns `employee_id`, `employee_name`, and `salary_amount`, write a SQL query to fetch the top 5 employees with the highest salary.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM salary
ORDER BY salary_amount DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Q3: Count Employees in Each Department
From the `employees` table with columns `employee_id`, `employee_name`, and `department`, write a SQL query to count the number of employees in each department and display the department name along with the count.

| employee_id | employee_name  | department | salary |
|-------------|----------------|------------|--------|
| 1           | John Smith     | Sales      | 5000   |
| 2           | Jane Doe       | Marketing  | 5500   |
| 3           | David Johnson  | Sales      | 5200   |
| 4           | Emily Brown    | HR         | 4800   |
| 5           | Michael Lee    | Marketing  | 5800   |
| 6           | Laura Gill     | IT         | 6000   |


```SQL
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as number_of_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

SELECT `department`, `COUNT(*) as number_of_employees`: This part of the SQL statement specifies what will be included in the result set. 

It is selecting the `department` column and the count of rows (*) for each department. 

`COUNT(*)` counts the number of rows in each group. The as `number_of_employees` part is aliasing, giving a name to the new column that will hold the count of employees in each department.

`FROM employees`: This part specifies the table from which to retrieve the data, which is the employees table in this case.

`GROUP BY department`: This clause groups the result set by unique values in the department column. 

For each unique department in the employees table, SQL will create a group and then perform any aggregate functions (like `COUNT(*)`) on each group.

Result:
| department | number_of_employees |
|------------|---------------------|
| Sales      | 2                   |
| Marketing  | 2                   |
| HR         | 1                   |
| IT         | 1                   |


## Q4: List the Employees with NULL Salaries
Given an `employees` table with columns `employee_id`, `employee_name`, and `salary`, write a SQL query to retrieve the `employee_id` and `employee_name` of all employees with a `null` salary.

```sql
SELECT employee_id, employee_name
FROM employees
WHERE salary IS NULL;
```

## Q5: Average Salary by Department
Given an `employees` table with columns `employee_id`, `employee_name`, `department`, and `salary`, write a SQL query to find the average salary for each department and display the department name along with the average salary.

| employee_id | employee_name  | department | salary |
|-------------|----------------|------------|--------|
| 1           | John Smith     | Sales      | 5000   |
| 2           | Jane Doe       | Marketing  | 5500   |
| 3           | David Johnson  | Sales      | 5200   |
| 4           | Emily Brown    | HR         | 4800   |
| 5           | Michael Lee    | Marketing  | 5800   |
| 6           | Laura Gill     | IT         | 6000   |

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) as average_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

`SELECT department, AVG(salary) as average_salary`: Here, the `AVG()` function is used to calculate the average value of the salary column for each group of departments. 

The as `average_salary` is giving a name to the new column that will hold the average salary of each department.

`FROM employees`: Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data, the employees table.

`GROUP BY department`: Similar to the previous query, it groups the result set by unique values in the department column.

Result:

| department | average_salary |
|------------|----------------|
| Sales      | 5100           |
| Marketing  | 5650           |
| HR         | 4800           |
| IT         | 6000           |

## Q6: No duplicate values 

In the given table employees, retrieve the distinct values of the department column using SQL. Write a query that includes the DISTINCT keyword to ensure that the result set only contains unique department values.

Table: employees

| employee_id | employee_name | department |
|---|---|---|
|1|	John Smith|	Sales |
|2|	Jane Doe|	Marketing|
|3|	David Johnson|	Sales|
|4|	Emily Brown|	HR|
|5|	Michael Lee	|Marketing|
|5|	Laura Gill	|IT|

Write a SQL query to obtain the distinct values of the department column from the employees table, ensuring that duplicate department values are excluded from the result set.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT employees.department
FROM employees;
```

We can write DISTINCT keyword to get rid of the duplicate results.

We can also write `department`. We wrote `employees.department` because it is clearer that `department` is from `employees` table.


## Q7: Retrieve Employees in Specific Departments

Given an `employees` table with columns `employee_id`, `employee_name`, and `department`, write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for employees who work in either the 'Sales' or 'Marketing' department.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing');
```

## Q8: Find Employees with Salaries Above Average in Their Departments

Given an `employees` table with columns `employee_id`, `employee_name`, `department`, and `salary`, write a SQL query to find all employees whose salary is above the average salary of their respective departments.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees e2
    WHERE e1.department = e2.department
);
```

# Summary

# UPDATE

```SQL
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

# SELECT

```SQL
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

# DELETE

```SQL
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
